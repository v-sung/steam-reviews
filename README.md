## CONTRIBUTORS
Lucien W, [Chaitali D](https://github.com/cadeshmukh02), Rhea D, and Tina Z were part of this group project.

## WHAT WE DID
We used a [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset) and a [Steam Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kieranpoc/steam-reviews). Big shout out to the dataset uploaders for the hard work of scraping data so we didn't have to do it. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

With those datasets combined, we analyzed the data to try and gain insight on what drives positive reviews of a game, e.g. price, genre, etc.

## WHAT I DID
The parts I contributed to specifically are:
- Loading and initial cleaning of the Games dataset
- Game review sentiment over time (sampled for games with at least 1 year of review data)
- Early vs late review sentiment (sampled for games with at least 2 years of review data)
- Top publishers by average review sentiment (filtered to those with over 10,000 reviews)
